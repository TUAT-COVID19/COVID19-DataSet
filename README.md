# COVID19-DataSet
This is the data repository for the COVID-19. We try to unify the format of the COVID-19.  
We have already unified that in Japan! Now, we attempt to create unified data for each area narrower than prefecture (prefecture is like a U.S. state).  
  
Every data is stored by the same JSON format. Item "date" and "data" has values in list.
