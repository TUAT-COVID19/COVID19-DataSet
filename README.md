# COVID19-DataSet
This is the data repository for the COVID-19 in Japan. We try to unify the format of the COVID-19.  
We have already unified that in Japan! Now, we attempt to create unified data for each area narrower than prefecture (prefecture is like a U.S. state).  
  
Every data is stored by the same JSON format. Item "date", "data", "parent" and "child" have values in list.  
If data(positiveIncrease_release, positiveIncrease_onset, etc.) hasn't values, it has empty list.
